# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

Welcome! This README provides a map to the OctoAcme project management process documents and a summary of OctoAcme's approach.

## Summary of OctoAcme Project Management Processes

OctoAcme uses a structured, iterative approach to project delivery that emphasizes:

- **Customer-first focus** — prioritize customer value and usability in all decisions
- **Iterative delivery** — deliver small, testable increments to gather feedback and reduce risk
- **Clear ownership** — every project has a named Project Manager (PM) and Product Lead with defined responsibilities
- **Data-driven decisions** — measure impact and iterate based on evidence and metrics
- **Psychological safety** — encourage feedback, learning, and continuous improvement

### Project Lifecycle

OctoAcme projects follow a consistent five-phase lifecycle:

1. **Initiation** — Define the problem, business need, success metrics, and stakeholder alignment. Gate: confirm go/no-go to proceed to planning.
2. **Planning** — Break work into shippable increments, identify risks and dependencies, align timelines and responsibilities, and create a prioritized backlog.
3. **Execution & Tracking** — Manage day-to-day delivery through standups, sprints, and regular demos. Track progress, manage blockers, and maintain quality standards.
4. **Release & Deployment** — Standardize release processes to reduce risk. Deploy to production with verification, monitoring, and rollback procedures.
5. **Retrospective & Continuous Improvement** — Capture learnings and convert them into actionable improvements for future projects.

### Core Roles

- **Project Manager (PM)** — Coordinates delivery, manages schedules, risks, and communications
- **Product Manager (PdM)** — Defines outcomes, prioritizes the backlog, and measures success
- **Developers** — Implement features, collaborate on design and testability
- **QA/Testing** — Validate quality and acceptance criteria
- **Stakeholders** — Provide inputs, feedback, and approvals

### Key Artifacts

Every project maintains:
- Project Charter / One-pager
- Roadmap and Release Plan
- Sprint/Iteration Backlog
- Acceptance Criteria & Definition of Done
- Risk Register
- Retrospective notes and action items
